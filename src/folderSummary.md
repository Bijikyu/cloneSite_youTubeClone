The `App.js` file is the core component of a React application that handles the layout and routing using `react-router-dom`. It imports necessary components for routing (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`) and layout (`Box` from `@mui/material`). It also imports custom components (`Navbar`, `Feed`, `VideoDetail`, `ChannelDetail`, `SearchFeed`) from the components directory. The `App` component sets up the navigation bar and defines routes for the home page, individual video details, channel details, and search results, each rendering the appropriate component.

The `index.js` file serves as the entry point of the React application. It imports the React library, ReactDOM for rendering components to the DOM, the main `App` component, and the application's CSS styles. It initializes the root container by targeting the 'root' DOM element and renders the `App` component within this container, effectively starting the React application.
