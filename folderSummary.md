The `.env` file contains a single environment variable named `REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY` which is used to store the API key for Rapid API, essential for the React application to interact with Rapid API services securely.

The `.gitignore` file is a configuration file for Git that lists various files and directories that should not be tracked or uploaded to the repository. It includes common directories and files such as `node_modules` for npm dependencies, `.pnp` files for Yarn's Plug'n'Play feature, and `build` for production outputs. It also specifies ignoring various local environment files (`.env.local`, `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local`) to prevent sensitive data from being committed. Additionally, it excludes system-specific files like `.DS_Store` and log files like `npm-debug.log*`, `yarn-debug.log*`, and `yarn-error.log*` to keep the repository clean and focused on source code.
